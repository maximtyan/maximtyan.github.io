I am an **Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering** at [New Uzbekistan University](https://newuu.uz/en/employee/category/faculty-members?department_id=24). I joined the university in 2024 after fifteen years in the Department of **Aerospace Engineering** at Konkuk University in South Korea, where I held various positions ranging from researcher to assistant professor.

My research interests include aircraft design and development, as well as multidisciplinary design and optimization. I have been involved in numerous projects spanning different stages of aircraft development, from market analysis and conceptual design to flight test, simulation, and certification. For these projects, my team and I have developed numerous analysis, design, optimization, and simulation software tools. These projects have covered a wide range of aircraft types, including manned general aviation aircraft, electric and hydrogen-powered eVTOLs, missiles, and UAVs.

I hold a PhD in Aerospace Information Engineering from Konkuk University, South Korea and BSc in Aerospace Engineering from Tashkent State Technical University. Throughout my career, I have contributed to more than twenty international and domestic (Korean) research projects, with a total funding volume exceeding 25 million USD.
