	abstract = {Electric aircraft emerge as a promising solution to mitigate the environmental impact of the aviation sector. The integration of electric propulsion components in such aircraft differs significantly from that of conventional aircraft. In the latter case, initial sizing frameworks typically employ mathematical models that operate solely with high-level propulsion parameters, such as power, thrust, and efficiency. However, in the case of advanced air mobility (AAM) aircraft, the propulsion system integration at the sizing stage is critical to exploring more comprehensive configurations and avoiding infeasible solutions. We introduce a framework for designing AAM aircraft, emphasizing the crucial integration of propulsion components from the initial phase. It combines top-level, low-fidelity methods, higher-fidelity components, and system-level propulsion analysis. This modular approach facilitates realistic aircraft configuration exploration by efficiently balancing high and low-fidelity studies. This integrated approach significantly reduces the risk of infeasible or impractical solutions and allows for adaptable coupling with various models of differing fidelity. We demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness by designing and analyzing a box-wing vertical takeoff and landing electric aircraft. Key results suggest setting the propeller pitch optimally at each mission segment increases the cruising range of aircraft by at least 10\%. Similarly, varying the battery cell type with a fixed pack mass results in up to 10 km gain in cruising range for the optimal cruise speed. Propeller pitch, battery cell type, and other parameters are often omitted in the initial sizing stage. Our results emphasize the high sensitivity of aircraft performance to these parameters. The proposed framework illustrates its potential to advance electric aircraft design, contributing to a more sustainable future in aviation.},

	abstract = {Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling (MFSM) methods are gaining recognition for their effectiveness in addressing simulation-based design challenges. Prior approaches have typically relied on recursive techniques, combining a limited number of high-fidelity (HF) samples with multiple low-fidelity (LF) datasets structured in hierarchical levels to generate a precise HF approximation model. However, challenges arise when dealing with non-level LF datasets, where the fidelity levels of LF models are indistinguishable across the design space. In such cases, conventional methods employing recursive frameworks may lead to inefficient LF dataset utilization and substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this work proposes the extended hierarchical Kriging (EHK) method, designed to simultaneously incorporate multiple non-level LF datasets for improved HF model construction, regardless of minor differences in fidelity levels. This method leverages a unique Bayesian-based MFSM framework, simultaneously combining non-level LF models using scaling factors to construct a global trend model. During model processing, unknown scaling factors are implicitly estimated through hyperparameter optimization, resulting in minimal computational costs during model processing, regardless of the number of LF datasets integrated, while maintaining the necessary accuracy in the resulting HF model. The advantages of the proposed EHK method are validated against state-of-the-art MFSM methods through various analytical examples and an engineering case study involving the construction of an aerodynamic database for the KP-2 eVTOL aircraft under various flying conditions. The results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in terms of computational cost and accuracy when generating aerodynamic models from the given multi-fidelity datasets.},

	abstract = {Multi-fidelity Data Fusion (MDF) frameworks have emerged as a prominent approach to producing economical but accurate surrogate models for aerodynamic data modeling by integrating data with different fidelity levels. However, most existing MDF frameworks assume a uniform data structure between sampling data sources; thus, producing an accurate solution at the required level, for cases of non-uniform data structures is challenging. To address this challenge, an Adaptive Multi-fidelity Data Fusion (AMDF) framework is proposed to produce a composite surrogate model which can efficiently model multi-fidelity data featuring non-uniform structures. Firstly, the design space of the input data with non-uniform data structures is decomposed into subdomains containing simplified structures. Secondly, different MDF frameworks and a rule-based selection process are adopted to construct multiple local models for the subdomain data. On the other hand, the Enhanced Local Fidelity Modeling (ELFM) method is proposed to combine the generated local models into a unique and continuous global model. Finally, the resulting model inherits the features of local models and approximates a complete database for the whole design space. The validation of the proposed framework is performed to demonstrate its approximation capabilities in (A) four multi-dimensional analytical problems and (B) a practical engineering case study of constructing an F16C fighter aircraft’s aerodynamic database. Accuracy comparisons of the generated models using the proposed AMDF framework and conventional MDF approaches using a single global modeling algorithm are performed to reveal the adaptability of the proposed approach for fusing multi-fidelity data featuring non-uniform structures. Indeed, the results indicated that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art MDF approach in the cases of non-uniform data.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-objective optimal sizing method for a cruise missile with a multi-phase mission involving a boost phase and an air-breathing phase. Proposed method includes a mission profile analysis which simplifies the compound mission profile of the cruise missile to enable the missile to be sized in the conceptual design phase. Since a boost phase is usually included in the mission of a cruise missile to enable fast acceleration immediately after launch, a booster sizing method is also presented. After the booster phase, there is an air-breathing phase that includes climb and acceleration, cruise, etc. For this phase, we first present a hybrid method for predicting drag, which is difficult to estimate in the existing sizing process. In addition, tail sizing is included, based on the reverse application of longitudinal stability processes. We also present a mission analysis method for estimating fuel consumption in the sizing step. Proposed sizing method is implemented using a Python-based sizing tool, and includes all the processes associated with the sizing method presented in this paper. Finally, we perform a sizing that includes multi-objective optimization, with the aim of minimizing the total launch weight and maximizing the total range.},

	abstract = {At the early stage of aircraft design, the sizing process plays a critical role in determining key parameters such as mass, geometry, and propulsion system characteristics based on design requirements. However, existing sizing methods, relying on historical data, assumptions, and low-fidelity models, often fail to address uncertainties, leading to costly design modifications, particularly for electric aircraft, where technological uncertainties pose significant challenges. It is crucial to account for uncertainties at the sizing stage to ensure reliable outcomes, highlighting the need for a method that efficiently integrates uncertainty into the process. We propose a possibility-based sizing approach, which accounts for design uncertainties into sizing process, yields possible feasible design outcomes and identifies critical parameters for refinement in later stages. We verified our approach with two case studies meeting CS23 certification. The results demonstrate design feasibility through trade-offs between conservative and optimistic designs, with possibility indices from 0.75 to 1, identifying maximum and stall speeds as key limiting factors. Sensitivity analysis shows that aerodynamic design, airframe, and propulsion efficiencies significantly impact maximum takeoff mass. Propulsion system integration achieves a relative mass reduction of 0.05, outperforming hydrogen fuel cells (0.025) and battery systems (0.009). The study highlights that power density is more critical than battery energy density in high-power segments, providing valuable insights for sizing and key parameters in future hybrid electric aircraft development.},
