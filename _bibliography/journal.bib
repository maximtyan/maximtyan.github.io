	abstract = {Adaptive sampling is an iterative process for the construction of a global approximation model. Most of engineering analysis tools computes multiple parameters in a single run. This research proposes a novel multi-response adaptive sampling algorithm for simultaneous construction of multiple surrogate models in a time-efficient and accurate manner. The new algorithm uses the Jackknife cross-validation variance and a minimum distance metric to construct a sampling criterion function. A weighted sum of the function is used to consider the characteristics of multiple surrogate models. The proposed algorithm demonstrates good performance on total 22 numerical problems in comparison with three existing adaptive sampling algorithms. The numerical problems include several two-dimensional and six-dimensional functions which are combined into single-response and multi-response systems. Application of the proposed algorithm for construction of aerodynamic tables for 2D airfoil is demonstrated. Scaling-based variable-fidelity modeling is implemented to enhance the accuracy of surrogate modeling. The algorithm succeeds in constructing a system of three highly nonlinear aerodynamic response surfaces within a reasonable amount of time while preserving high accuracy of approximation.},

	abstract = {Purpose

Major changes of an aircraft configuration are conducted during the early design stage. It is important to include the airworthiness regulations at this stage while there is extensive freedom for designing. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an efficient design framework that integrates airworthiness guidelines and documentation at the early design stage.

Design/methodology/approach
A new design and optimization process is proposed that logically includes the airworthiness regulations as design parameters and constraints by constructing a certification database. The design framework comprises requirements analysis, preliminary sizing, conceptual design synthesis and loads analysis. A design certification relation table (DCRT) describes the legal regulations in terms of parameters and values suitable for use in design optimization.

Findings
The developed framework has been validated and demonstrated for the design of a Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 23 four-seater small aircraft. The validation results show an acceptable level of accuracy to be applied during the early design stage. The total mass minimization problem has been successfully solved while satisfying all the design requirements and certification constraints specified in the DCRT. Moreover, successful compliance with FAR 23 subpart C is demonstrated. The proposed method is a useful tool for design optimization and compliance verifications during the early stages of aircraft development.

Practical implications
The new certification database proposed in this research makes it simpler for engineers to access a large amount of legal documentation related to airworthiness regulations and provides a link between the regulation text and actual design parameters and their bounds.

Originality/value
The proposed design optimization framework integrates the certification database that is built of several types of legal documents such as regulations, advisory circulars and standards. The Engineering Requirements and Guide summarizes all the documents and design requirements into a single document. The DCRT is created as a summary table that indicates the design parameters affected by a given regulation(s), the design stage at which the parameter can be evaluated and its value bounds. The introduction of the certification database into the design optimization framework significantly reduces the engineer’s load related for airworthiness regulations.},

	abstract = {Path planning of autonomous mobile robots in a real-world environment presents several challenges which are usually not raised in other areas. The real world is inherently complex, uncertain and dynamic. Therefore, accurate models of path planning are difficult to obtain and quickly become outdated. Anytime planners are ideal for this type of problem as they can find an initial solution very quickly and then improve it as time allows. This paper proposes a new anytime incremental search algorithm named improved Anytime Dynamic A*(iADA*). The algorithm is based on the currently popular anytime heuristic search algorithm, which is Anytime Dynamic A*(ADA*). The iADA* algorithm improves the calculation of the path lengths and decreases the calculating frequency of the path throughout the search, making it significantly faster. The algorithm is designed to provide an efficient solution to a complex, dynamic search environment when the locally changes affected. Our study shows that the two-dimensional path-planning iADA* experiments were between 2.0 to 3.7 times faster than ADA*, both in partially known and fully unknown dynamic environments. Additionally, in this paper shows the experiment results of the comparison with other four existing algorithms based on computing time and path lengths. iADA* was an average 2.57 times reduced on the computational time for the environment which locally changes effected. For the path length is little increase, but it is not the worst case. According to the experiments, the more the environmental problems and complexity increases, the more iADA* provides a rapid in-search time and total time to obtain the final solution.},

	abstract = {The spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic across countries all over the world urges governments to revolutionize the traditional medical hospitals/centers to provide sustainable and trustworthy medical services to patients under the pressure of the huge overload on the computing systems of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for medical monitoring as well as treatment services of medical professionals. Uncertain malfunctions in any part of the medical computing infrastructure, from its power system in a remote area to the local computing systems at a smart hospital, can cause critical failures in medical monitoring services, which could lead to a fatal loss of human life in the worst case. Therefore, early design in the medical computing infrastructure’s power and computing systems needs to carefully consider the dependability characteristics, including the reliability and availability of the WSNs in smart hospitals under an uncertain outage of any part of the energy resources or failures of computing servers, especially due to software aging. In that regard, we propose reliability and availability models adopting stochastic Petri net (SPN) to quantify the impact of energy resources and server rejuvenation on the dependability of medical sensor networks. Three different availability models (A, B, and C) are developed in accordance with various operational configurations of a smart hospital’s computing infrastructure to assimilate the impact of energy resource redundancy and server rejuvenation techniques for high availability. Moreover, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the components that impose the greatest impact on the system availability. The analysis results indicate different impacts of the considered configurations on the WSN’s operational availability in smart hospitals, particularly 99.40\%, 99.53\%, and 99.64\% for the configurations A, B, and C, respectively. This result highlights the difference of 21 h of downtime per year when comparing the worst with the best case. This study can help leverage the early design of smart hospitals considering its wireless medical sensor networks’ dependability in quality of service to cope with overloading medical services in world-wide virus pandemics.},

This paper presents a comprehensive method for FW-VTOL electric UAV sizing and resizing. The method uses newly developed integrated analysis that combines the VTOL propulsion sizing method with modified FW aircraft sizing theories. Performance requirements are specified as a set of functional relations. Several new empirical equations are derived using available data. The required battery capacity and total mass are determined from mission analysis that includes both VTOL and FW mission segments. The design is iteratively resized when the actual components of the propulsion system are selected. A case study of a 3.5-kg FW-VTOL electric UAV is presented in this research. The results of sizing and resizing are compared to parameters of the actual aircraft manufactured. Prediction of most parameters stays within a 10\% error threshold.},

Analysis methods cannot fully represent the real physical phenomena, and hence the optimum solution may fail to satisfy the constraints when more sophisticated analysis is applied. This research proposes the use of a database to estimate the prediction errors associated with a particular analysis method. Newly proposed adaptive piecewise-linear fuzzy membership functions accurately represent the intervals of prediction errors to compensate for the discrepancies caused by analysis. A possibility-based design optimization framework is developed to solve nonprobabilistic design problems with uncertainties represented by the adaptive piecewise-linear fuzzy membership intervals. A two-seater light aircraft design problem has been solved to demonstrate the proposed method. The adaptive piecewise-linear fuzzy membership fu{\textbackslash}nctions for six major analysis modules of in-house software were constructed using information about 15 aircraft stored in the database. Estimated errors of the analysis stay within 10\% range. The adaptive piecewise-linear fuzzy membership function for selected parameters stores 39\% more samples on average than the triangular functions that are traditionally used for possibility-based design optimization. The results of the design problem show that the objective function is improved by 3.4\% with uncertain intervals covering 100\% of database samples and by 46.1\% with 12.3\% database coverage.},

The developed tailless UAV design framework combines multiple disciplines that are based on low-fidelity and empirical analysis methods. An automated high-fidelity aerodynamic analysis is efficiently integrated into the MDO framework. Global variable fidelity modeling algorithm manages the use of the high-fidelity analysis to enhance the overall accuracy of the MDO by providing the initial sampling of the design space with iterative refinement of the approximation model in the neighborhood of the optimum solution. A design formulation was established considering a specific aerodynamic, stability and control design features of a tailless aircraft configuration with a UCAV specific mission profile. Design optimization problems with low-fidelity and variable fidelity analyses were successfully solved. The objective function improvement is 14.5\% and 15.9\% with low and variable fidelity optimization respectively. Results also indicate that low-fidelity analysis overestimates the value of lift-to-drag ratio by 3-5\%, while the variable fidelity results are equal to the high-fidelity analysis results by algorithm definition.},

	abstract = {Electric aircraft emerge as a promising solution to mitigate the environmental impact of the aviation sector. The integration of electric propulsion components in such aircraft differs significantly from that of conventional aircraft. In the latter case, initial sizing frameworks typically employ mathematical models that operate solely with high-level propulsion parameters, such as power, thrust, and efficiency. However, in the case of advanced air mobility (AAM) aircraft, the propulsion system integration at the sizing stage is critical to exploring more comprehensive configurations and avoiding infeasible solutions. We introduce a framework for designing AAM aircraft, emphasizing the crucial integration of propulsion components from the initial phase. It combines top-level, low-fidelity methods, higher-fidelity components, and system-level propulsion analysis. This modular approach facilitates realistic aircraft configuration exploration by efficiently balancing high and low-fidelity studies. This integrated approach significantly reduces the risk of infeasible or impractical solutions and allows for adaptable coupling with various models of differing fidelity. We demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness by designing and analyzing a box-wing vertical takeoff and landing electric aircraft. Key results suggest setting the propeller pitch optimally at each mission segment increases the cruising range of aircraft by at least 10\%. Similarly, varying the battery cell type with a fixed pack mass results in up to 10 km gain in cruising range for the optimal cruise speed. Propeller pitch, battery cell type, and other parameters are often omitted in the initial sizing stage. Our results emphasize the high sensitivity of aircraft performance to these parameters. The proposed framework illustrates its potential to advance electric aircraft design, contributing to a more sustainable future in aviation.},

	abstract = {Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling (MFSM) methods are gaining recognition for their effectiveness in addressing simulation-based design challenges. Prior approaches have typically relied on recursive techniques, combining a limited number of high-fidelity (HF) samples with multiple low-fidelity (LF) datasets structured in hierarchical levels to generate a precise HF approximation model. However, challenges arise when dealing with non-level LF datasets, where the fidelity levels of LF models are indistinguishable across the design space. In such cases, conventional methods employing recursive frameworks may lead to inefficient LF dataset utilization and substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this work proposes the extended hierarchical Kriging (EHK) method, designed to simultaneously incorporate multiple non-level LF datasets for improved HF model construction, regardless of minor differences in fidelity levels. This method leverages a unique Bayesian-based MFSM framework, simultaneously combining non-level LF models using scaling factors to construct a global trend model. During model processing, unknown scaling factors are implicitly estimated through hyperparameter optimization, resulting in minimal computational costs during model processing, regardless of the number of LF datasets integrated, while maintaining the necessary accuracy in the resulting HF model. The advantages of the proposed EHK method are validated against state-of-the-art MFSM methods through various analytical examples and an engineering case study involving the construction of an aerodynamic database for the KP-2 eVTOL aircraft under various flying conditions. The results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in terms of computational cost and accuracy when generating aerodynamic models from the given multi-fidelity datasets.},

	abstract = {The electric propulsion system (EPS) comprises various components, such as a battery, motor, controller, and propeller. Accurate analysis of these components requires many detailed parameters which can be challenging to obtain during the initial design phases. This article presents a method for constructing a calibration and global prediction model for a family of EPS components, to overcome analysis limitations during these design stages. A low-fidelity (LF) analysis method is developed to predict EPS performance with a given set of specifications, and wind tunnel tests are conducted to provide high-fidelity data. A linear calibration model is developed by modifying theoretical equations to include relative additive terms and coefficients. Subsequently, a global prediction model is generated using a radial basis function (RBF) network. The model predicts calibration coefficients for a set of target EPS combinations without corresponding high-fidelity data. By substituting these coefficients into the modified equations, EPS performance can be predicted with enhanced accuracy, without requiring additional high-fidelity analysis. Three examples of global prediction models are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and current limits of the method.},

	abstract = {Multi-fidelity Data Fusion (MDF) frameworks have emerged as a prominent approach to producing economical but accurate surrogate models for aerodynamic data modeling by integrating data with different fidelity levels. However, most existing MDF frameworks assume a uniform data structure between sampling data sources; thus, producing an accurate solution at the required level, for cases of non-uniform data structures is challenging. To address this challenge, an Adaptive Multi-fidelity Data Fusion (AMDF) framework is proposed to produce a composite surrogate model which can efficiently model multi-fidelity data featuring non-uniform structures. Firstly, the design space of the input data with non-uniform data structures is decomposed into subdomains containing simplified structures. Secondly, different MDF frameworks and a rule-based selection process are adopted to construct multiple local models for the subdomain data. On the other hand, the Enhanced Local Fidelity Modeling (ELFM) method is proposed to combine the generated local models into a unique and continuous global model. Finally, the resulting model inherits the features of local models and approximates a complete database for the whole design space. The validation of the proposed framework is performed to demonstrate its approximation capabilities in (A) four multi-dimensional analytical problems and (B) a practical engineering case study of constructing an F16C fighter aircraft’s aerodynamic database. Accuracy comparisons of the generated models using the proposed AMDF framework and conventional MDF approaches using a single global modeling algorithm are performed to reveal the adaptability of the proposed approach for fusing multi-fidelity data featuring non-uniform structures. Indeed, the results indicated that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art MDF approach in the cases of non-uniform data.},

	abstract = {A deep-learning based rapid engineering design (DL-RED) algorithm is developed and presented for solving engineering inverse design problems. The algorithm generates an inverse design deep neural network (IDNN) by performing a two-stage hyperparameter selection and iteratively enhancing training database. The initial hyperparameter selection defines the configuration of IDNN that increases the accuracy of inverse design and reduces the network training time. Then database enhancement loop refines the training database by iteratively adding new samples to initial database based on results of validation. After the training database is generated the final hyperparameter selection is performed. A construction of Airfoil inverse design neural network is demonstrated in this paper. The Airfoil-IDNN generates a NACA 4-series airfoil that corresponds to target aerodynamic parameters given as an input. During the database enhancement loop the validation mean squared error has reduced to 57.37\%, and totally to 96.48\% after the final hyperparameter selection. The accuracy of the Airfoil-IDNN was demonstrated using two case studies. The first case study shows how accurate the network can generate an airfoil with arbitrary input parameters. The second one shows whether the IDNN can generate existing airfoils by a set of target parameters.},

Proposed method includes a mission profile analysis which simplifies the compound mission profile of the cruise missile to enable the missile to be sized in the conceptual design phase. Since a boost phase is usually included in the mission of a cruise missile to enable fast acceleration immediately after launch, a booster sizing method is also presented. After the booster phase, there is an air-breathing phase that includes climb and acceleration, cruise, etc. For this phase, we first present a hybrid method for predicting drag, which is difficult to estimate in the existing sizing process. In addition, tail sizing is included, based on the reverse application of longitudinal stability processes. We also present a mission analysis method for estimating fuel consumption in the sizing step. Proposed sizing method is implemented using a Python-based sizing tool, and includes all the processes associated with the sizing method presented in this paper. Finally, we perform a sizing that includes multi-objective optimization, with the aim of minimizing the total launch weight and maximizing the total range.},

	abstract = {At the early stage of aircraft design, the sizing process plays a critical role in determining key parameters such as mass, geometry, and propulsion system characteristics based on design requirements. However, existing sizing methods, relying on historical data, assumptions, and low-fidelity models, often fail to address uncertainties, leading to costly design modifications, particularly for electric aircraft, where technological uncertainties pose significant challenges. It is crucial to account for uncertainties at the sizing stage to ensure reliable outcomes, highlighting the need for a method that efficiently integrates uncertainty into the process. We propose a possibility-based sizing approach, which accounts for design uncertainties into sizing process, yields possible feasible design outcomes and identifies critical parameters for refinement in later stages. We verified our approach with two case studies meeting CS23 certification. The results demonstrate design feasibility through trade-offs between conservative and optimistic designs, with possibility indices from 0.75 to 1, identifying maximum and stall speeds as key limiting factors. Sensitivity analysis shows that aerodynamic design, airframe, and propulsion efficiencies significantly impact maximum takeoff mass. Propulsion system integration achieves a relative mass reduction of 0.05, outperforming hydrogen fuel cells (0.025) and battery systems (0.009). The study highlights that power density is more critical than battery energy density in high-power segments, providing valuable insights for sizing and key parameters in future hybrid electric aircraft development.},
